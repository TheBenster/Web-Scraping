<h1>Project Scope</h1>

I am creating a database of popular books for days when I don't want to research too much into the next book I want to read. This is also being created to develop practical experience using the webscraping library <b>BeautifulSoup</b>.

Alongside <b>BeautifulSoup</b> I will also be including <b>Pandas</b> to create a more established/concise database for easier functionality when I eventually get input from the user.

What I learned from the barebones of this project is that web scraping can be a very useful tool for gathering data from the web. BeautifulSoup is a powerful library that makes it easy to parse HTML and extract the data you need. Pandas is a great tool for creating and managing databases. Together, these tools can be used to create a powerful database of popular books.

I also learned that it is important to have a clear plan in mind when starting a project like this. I had to think about what data I wanted to collect (what lists to parse from, the DOM structure of the page), how I would collect it, and how I would store it. Once I had a plan, I was able to start working on the project and make progress quickly.

Overall, I am very happy with the results of this project. I learned a lot about web scraping, database management, and planning. I also have a database of popular books that I can use when I need a good book to read.

Eventually, I plan to make this database into a website using the Flask framework hopefully allowing me to share my database with others and make it easier for people to find books that they might be interested in. I also plan to add additional features to the website, such as the ability to rate books and eventually save them in a library.

I am excited about the potential of this project and I am looking forward to continuing to work on it.
